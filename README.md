# mathdoku
Mathdoku game simulation using Java and JavaFx 

This is a fully functioning Mathdoku game that allows the user to attempt to solve any valid Mathdoku game loaded. The rules of Sudoku apply to this game with the added feature of "cages", where the numbers in a set of squares must satisfy the condition of said cage. 

The user simply loads a text-based Mathdoku puzzle (see tools) either straight into the interface or using the file explorer. The user can then try and solve it, with aids such as undoing/redoing their last move, checking for mistakes, changing the font size and clearing the board. If the user solves the puzzle i.e. no errors are highlighted when checking for mistakes, a colourful animation appears. The user can also generate a random game by specifying the size of the puzzle, but at this moment in time the puzzle is not solvable.

Please see the 'demo' video for a brief overview of how the program functions.
